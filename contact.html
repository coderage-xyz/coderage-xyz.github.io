					We live on an interesting schedule but one that we've become very
					used to in the last ten years. John Connor lives in the United
					States (UTC-4) and Thomas lives in Denmark (UTC+2). We're six hours
					apart but still somehow have all the time we need to collaborate;
					hopefully anyone hoping to do the same with us can also do it with the
					same relative ease. We're by far the most active on Steam but Discord
					is also a viable choice of platform for contacting us. John Connor's
					Discord handle is
					<a href="https://discordapp.com/users/138383035794980864">piqey#1337</a>
					and Thomas's is
					<a href="https://discordapp.com/users/173178388763246592">MultiTee#9014</a>,
					though he is generally less active there.
