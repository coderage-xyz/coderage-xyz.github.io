						Once we became more familiar with the types of modes Facepunch was building
						<i>s&box</i> to accommodate, we moved our attention to building an FTL-inspired
						multiplayer experience where players work together to maintain and upgrade
						a spaceship. Each system you visit has any number of random encounters;
						friendly traders, distress beacons or even pirates that want your ship and
						won't be taking "no" for an answer.

						We had this idea for a <i>Garry's Mod</i> TTT server with a twist —
						players would be able to open crates to obtain weapons of different
						rarities that could be equipped in their inventory so that they spawn
						with them at the beginning of every round of the game they play. These
						weapons would have levels which could be increased via the use the
						weapons. By increasing the level of the weapon to certain points,
						“milestones” would be unlocked that added additional abilities to the
						weapon. The stats of these abilities would be random values set when
						the weapon item was first created (unboxed).
					</p>

					<p>
						Unfortunately, we don't have limitless resources to provide for ourselves while
						we work on our projects, and — subsequently — we require some form of income in
						order to keep the project going. We dislike as much as anyone the careless and
						greedy monetization of opportunity in modern video games, so we wanted to make
						a system where people did not feel like they had to contribute toward our server
						upkeep fees but would be fairly rewarded if they did choose to do so, without
						making the game unfair to those who didn't. Before even starting the project we
						fleshed out a basic idea of how we wanted to market donator perks on our server.

						Of the systems we did manage implement in the many months we were
						actively working on this project, several of them were in a state
						worth sharing. Among these were the inventory/equipment system,
						the procedural weapon decal/skinning system and the task system
						(albeit buggy).
					</p>

					<p>
						In the case of the inventory system, Thomas was greatly responsible
						for the back end framework that made it work, while I took charge by
						helping where I could as well as crafting a unique front end as best
						as I knew how. Many custom UI elements were created to get the result
						that we wanted. The assets for the cosmetics were also ripped from
						other games to appeal to individuals that may have played them.

						The procedural weapon skinning system was very likely my most
						favorite piece of work in the entire project. I ripped many
						textures of patterns meant for skinning weapons from
						<i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</i> that were each
						single textures composed of three channels such that they could be
						separated and colored to create a final pattern to be overlayed
						upon the weapon. Here is an example of one of these textures aside
						its three RGB channels, extracted from the directory
						"materials/models/weapons/customization/paints/" within the game's
						VPK files:

				<br /><br /> <!-- Seems to be needed only after non-paragraph elements. -->

				<div class="info">
					<p>
						I precomputed the split channels of each pattern, discarding their
						source texture and holding on to just the channels for in-game
						applications (in retrospect, not the best decision for disk space or
						download times). In-game, players could obtain skin items that were
						given three randomly generated colors at the time of their creation.
						When the skin was applied to a weapon, the skin item was deleted and
						its information passed onto the weapon item for saving within our
						database. Weapons with skin information saved within their properties
						called upon the weapon skinning module I created to network instructions
						regarding skins to clients for  building a new textures entirely within
						the client's memory based on data from the disk. These "temporary" textures 
						were used in the inventory as thumbnails as well as rendered additively
						atop both the weapon's view model and world model textures for a single
						frame, the resulting overlayed texture saved to memory and applied to
						those model instances for all clients.

						The last system we created that I've got a reasonably good video clip
						of was the task system. At the beginning of each round, all non-Traitor
						players were assigned 5 tasks around the level, each with their own
						form of minigame that needed to be completed. Upon the completion of all
						five of a player's tasks, a random reward picked from an arbitrary loot
						pool was given to the player as an incentive to complete more tasks in
						the future. The task system was most likely the least stable system we
						had in place during the project, spending most of its time manually
						disabled for playtesting. The structure I built this system to support
						was not future-proofed to any degree, and as such was more of an obstacle
						at times than it was a tool.

						In the end, the project's downfall was our inability to keep interest in it
						due to virtually no one playing on it other than the times I devoted all my
						resources exclusively to getting a few people to hop on for an hour.
						<i>Garry's Mod</i> has been around for quite some time and has become fairly
						oversaturated with variety, making it nearly impossible for anyone to discover
						anything truly new in the environment. We're still fairly proud of the things
						we accomplished during the 6 months or so we were working on this project.
						We'll likely be releasing the source code for it on the off chance anyone
						wants to learn how we accomplished some of the things we did.
